# MicrosatCode
The code Repository for the microsat project by Isha, Ivan, Gregoire, Ru√°n and Massimo
Please push the new files to the "Tested functional" branch and only after a few succesful tests commit it to the main branch

The code is split into Robot and VisualDataProcessing. Outside of all folders are 2 files, main.py runs the visual data processing side with pictures provided from a repository. ishaivanmain.py runs the robto side using a manually provided camera vector. This camera vector describes the distance from the center of the camera to the center of the object and is the output of the visual data processing side. 
These 2 segments have to be run seperately as the final integration step sadly fell outside of the scope of what we were able to achieve in the given period.
